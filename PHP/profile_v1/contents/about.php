<div class='about-me'>
	<p>	
	I am a web developer - a front-end web developer who is proudly proficient in HTML and CSS. I create user interface, with user experience as top priority. In achieving this, as a front-end developer, I make efficient use of libraries and frameworks like JQuery, Foundation, and Bootstrap. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Not only can I create passable - if not high quality - interfaces for users, but also can I create fully functional websites; for I am also a back-end developer. With the use of PHP alongside CodeIgniter, I could deliver functionality with design - creating highly-competitive web applications.
	</p>
	<p>
	With the ever-changing working environment, as new tools are developed over time, it is known that change is inevitable. This is why I keep an open mind to learning new technologies that could improve my output as a web developer. I am open to learning AngularJS, Vue js, Laravel, and other tools that could help me cope up with the fast-changing web development community.
	</p>
	<p>
	Aside from web programming, I am also a software developer who can code using Java, C, and C++. Other languages I have basic knowledge about are as follows: Assembly, Perl, Python,  COBOL, Lisp, and Prolog.
	</p>
	<p>
	With regards to team play, I am mostly the team leader - be it web programming or software developing; yet I could also be a follower, if the position suggests.
