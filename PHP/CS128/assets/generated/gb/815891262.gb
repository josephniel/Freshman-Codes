COMMENT     REVIEWED REFSEQ: This record has been curated by NCBI staff. The
            reference sequence was derived from AK310970.1, AY358996.1 and
            AW470748.1.
            On Apr 28, 2015 this sequence version replaced gi:767906295.
            
            Summary: Breast tumors are initially dependent on estrogens for
            growth and progression and can be inhibited by anti-estrogens such
            as tamoxifen. However, breast cancers progress to become
            anti-estrogen resistant. Breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance
            gene 3 was identified in the search for genes involved in the
            development of estrogen resistance. The gene encodes a component of
            intracellular signal transduction that causes estrogen-independent
            proliferation in human breast cancer cells. The protein contains a
            putative src homology 2 (SH2) domain, a hall mark of cellular
            tyrosine kinase signaling molecules, and is partly homologous to
            the cell division cycle protein CDC48. Multiple transcript variants
            encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
            [provided by RefSeq, May 2012].
            
            Transcript Variant: This variant (5) contains an alternate exon in
            the 5' UTR, lacks a portion of the 5' coding region, and initiates
            translation at a downstream start codon, compared to variant 1. The
            encoded isoform (3) has a significantly shorter N-terminus,
            compared to isoform 1.
