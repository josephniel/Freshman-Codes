COMMENT     REVIEWED REFSEQ: This record has been curated by NCBI staff. The
            reference sequence was derived from ATCQ01017778.1.
            On Sep 16, 2014 this sequence version replaced gi:591297548.
            
            Summary: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the antizyme
            inhibitor family, which plays a role in cell growth and
            proliferation by maintaining polyamine homeostasis within the cell.
            Antizyme inhibitors are homologs of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC,
            the key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis) that have lost the
            ability to decarboxylase ornithine; however, retain the ability to
            bind to antizymes. Antizymes negatively regulate intracellular
            polyamine levels by binding to ODC and targeting it for
            degradation, as well as by inhibiting polyamine uptake. Antizyme
            inhibitors function as positive regulators of polyamine levels by
            sequestering antizymes and neutralizing their effect. This gene
            encodes antizyme inhibitor 1, the first member of this gene family
            that is ubiquitously expressed, and is localized in the nucleus and
            cytoplasm. Overexpression of antizyme inhibitor 1 gene has been
            associated with increased proliferation, cellular transformation
            and tumorigenesis. Gene knockout studies showed that homozygous
            mutant mice lacking functional antizyme inhibitor 1 gene died at
            birth with abnormal liver morphology. Alternatively spliced
            transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by
            RefSeq, Sep 2014].
            
            Transcript Variant: This variant (3) lacks an internal 5'
            non-coding exon and uses an alternate in-frame acceptor splice site
            in the 3' coding region compared to variant 1. The resulting
            isoform (2) is 1 aa shorter than isoform 1.
            
            Sequence Note: The RefSeq transcript and protein were derived from
            genomic sequence to make the sequence consistent with the reference
            genome assembly. The genomic coordinates used for the transcript
            record were based on alignments.
